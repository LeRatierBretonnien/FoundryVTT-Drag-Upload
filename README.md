# Drag Upload (Get Over Here!)

Adds the ability to drag files onto the Foundry canvas to automatically create Tokens, Tiles, Journal Pins, and Ambient Audio

![](./dragupload.gif)

If the file is an audio file (.mp3, .mp4, .wav, .flac), it will be created as an Ambient Audio with easing.

Otherwise, it will be treated as an Image and created based on the current active layer:

Token: 1x1 Actor with Token
Tile: Tile of the same size as the image
Notes: Journal with a corresponding Journal Pin
Other: Same as Token
